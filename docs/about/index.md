# A Brief History
Leaf was created by [Nic Dobbins](https://github.com/ndobb), PhD, the Principal Solutions Architect at UW Medicine Research IT. Leaf began as a simple experiment to recreate the power of cohort discovery tools like [i2b2](https://www.i2b2.org/), but with the ability to query any database structure, and with a friendly, intuitive user interface. 

Since then, Leaf has grown into an institutionally-supported research tool integral to biomedical research at the University of Washington, and was released to the public domain as open-source software in spring 2019.

# Team Members
[Nic Dobbins](https://github.com/ndobb) continues to lead Leaf feature development at UW. Leaf was co-developed by [Cliff Spital](https://github.com/cspital), now at UW Web Services. [Sean Mooney](http://bime.uw.edu/faculty/sean-mooney/), Chief Research Information Officer of UW Medicine and Professor of Biomedical Informatics & Medical Education, serves as faculty champion.

At UW, Leaf has been a successful cohort discovery tool with hundreds of active users. We believe Leaf is a strong component to an ongoing culture change in research computing.

# Leaf Governance Committee
The multi-institutional Leaf Governance Committee was created in 2019 to foster networking and collaboration across CTSA hubs. The committees aim is to support growth, to steer enhancements and oversee governance of the Leaf user community. The committee members are top in the Research Informatics field from institutions across the nation.
